/*

   This program is a menu where a user can browse their computer and select 
   which files they want to backup or not. 

   - I want it to have autocomplete (when your press tab)
   - I want double tab (tab + tab) to work
   
   - Should be a fully functional menu (or at lest as much of one as can be made)
